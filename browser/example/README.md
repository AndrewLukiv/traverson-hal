This folder contains an example html page and accompanying assets that shows how Traverson works in the browser. You need to start the test server with `node bin/start-test-server.js`, which serves index.html and the static assets as well as the REST API that is used in the example. Then open the URL `http://localhost:2808/static/browser/example` in your browser and click on "Start All Requests At Once" to get Traverson going.
