This folder contains a test harness to run the mocha tests in the browser. You need to start the test server with `bin/start-test-server.sh`, which serves the index.html page as well as the REST API that is used in some of the tests. Then open the URL `http://localhost:2808/static/browser/test` and watch the mocha tests run.
