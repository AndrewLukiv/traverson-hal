* Use RequireJS config to define aliases so that Node.js and browser requires
  are the same
* In-browser tests, preferably the same as are used for Node.js
* Shims for browser/node-cross-platform compatibility

* One codebase for Node.js and browser. Merge again with master branch.
  Beware: Changes in a0f6f6c65ea7af905e560da5a9fdc1ad61b0f895 in
  walker_builder.js could be a problem in Node. Or maybe the fix is alo needed
  there?
* Replace stupid hand-written test server by an express based test server
* Further reduce file size by excluding underscore and lodash, providing shims
  for the few functions that are used or detect if they are loaded anyway.
