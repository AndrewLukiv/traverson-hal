* Add to Grunt build:
  - create production browser build (RequireJS optimizer, minification)
  - In-browser tests against development version and production build
    + in-browser cli tests: phantomjs + cli + mocha
    + testling to test compatibiliy with real browsers
* Replace stupid hand-written test server by an express based test server
  - clean up test server document and link structure,
* Polish in-browser example page:
  - make each step during link following visible
  - pretty print code snippets, syntax highlighting, etc.
  - Remove jquery and use something smaller
  - make it use the production build
* Further reduce file size:
    * Excluding underscore and lodash, providing shims for the few functions that are used or detect if they are loaded anyway.
    * Browserified Halbert is 215 KB. That's far too much
